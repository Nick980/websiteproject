        <h2 class="posone">1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
            <p>IT in modern business allows companies to offer faster, better and more tailored experiences to their customers, 
                whilst also improving efficiency and driving down costs. A company with a strong IT skill set and backbone is at an 
                advantage compared to a competitor who lacks these skills. IT allows businesses to speed up decision making by providing 
                detailed and accurate information quickly.
                <br>
                <br>
                IT via digital marketing also allows companies to reach new customers more easily than in the past and information about 
                their customers can be gathered using IT systems such as online browsing habits. Customer service can also be enhanced 
                using IT by allowing customers to easily reach relevant support staff and many problems can be solved remotely without 
                incurring the cost of sending someone to the customers site.
                <br>
                <br>
                IT also allows business to recruit the best people for the job by removing the barrier of location. Virtual offices can allow staff to work from remote location with teams from around the world

        <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully 
                <br>
                <i>What do you need to make projects successful?
                What tools? What skills?</i></h2>
            <p>Planning is key to a successful project, so having a working methodology such as Kanban and Scrum will help greatly. At the 
                start of the project a clear list of requirements should be laid out, the team should then be reviewed to ensure the correct 
                skillset is present and if not additional people or learning may have to be taken on board. The required resources should 
                also be reviewed to ensure that those are present.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once those steps are completed the task should be broken up and parts assigned to individual team members based on their skillset. 
                Regular reviews and updates should then be performed and the requirements kept up to date.

        <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT 
            <br>
             <i>e.g. Making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to
                your trello board.</i></h2>
            <p>  I will mainly use Trello to plan the development of the website. I will do this by breaking the project down into specific tasks and using three columns to track the status. These columns will be labeled "To Do", "Doing" and "Done", as each task progresses it will pass between each of these columns until all tasks are under "Done".
                <br>
                <br>
                The main tool I will use to create the site will be Visual Studio Code as this is a strong coding tool and is easy to use allowing me to focus on the task rather than dealing with more complex programs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additional software I will use to edit and create images will be Adobe Photoshop Elements as this is a quick and easy tool to use. Any videos to be created will be completed in Abode Premiere, however I do not anticipate needing to create any videos.
                <br>

            <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects 
            <br>
            <i>What causes digital projects to fail? Why?</i></h2>
            <p>There are many risks which can impact a digital project, some of these can be controlled by the project team and others are due to external factors. Some of the risk are;
                The initial scope was poorly defined/inaccurate requirements/shifting objectives – This is  often an external factor where the client is unsure of exactly what they need or want, however can be caused by poor internal communication about the direction of the project and its requirements. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Trying to do too much work all at once – taking on too much work stretches resources thin and often leads to a shotgun approach where lots of little bits of projects get done but no specific part of the project gets the attention it needs
                <br>
                <br>
                Disparity of views between Marketing and IT – it is important that from the outset all stakeholders in a project have a clear unified vision of what the outcome of the project should be. Having marketing selling a product that is wildly different to that being developed will lead to unhappy customers and reputational damaged.
                <br>
                <br>
                Uninvolved project sponsors – again it is vital all stakeholders are on board and clear about the direction of the project, uninvolved participants often surface later in a project only to discover it is not what they expected or required. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Inaccurate estimates and insufficient resources – over committing on a project will lead to short falls in the ultimate output of the project. It is best to be honest about the requirements at the start of a project and plan accordingly.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Each of these ricks can cause potential harm to a project or lead to a product being created that is of no use to the client, as such these issues should be considered when planning out a project.

            <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software 
            <br>
            <i>How do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</i></h2>
            <p>Software and systems should be selected on the basis of what will fit the client needs, are known by your 
                team and will be maintainable going forward, there is no point in writing an application in a dying code 
                which will then need to be rewritten down the line to make it work with more modern systems. Thought should 
                also been given to the roll out of the product, if it is a mobile app on a phone it would potentially be better 
                to write the code in a common language rather than write multiple code bases for the different devices, whereas 
                apps for specific devices might be better written in the devices native language to enable best performance 
                and compatibility with said device.

            <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. 
            <br>
            <i>How has Trello helped you plan and how can Git and GitHub help with your codes version control</i></h2>
            <p>The website Trello helped me with planning and tracking the completion of my website and allowed me to see where I needed to focus on to reach completion.
                <br>
                <br>
                Visual Studio Code was a good step on the Codepen.io and it’s built in suggestions and error spotting helped greatly in writing the HTML and CSS code. The way the program displays the files which make up the website also helped visualise how the pages where connected and where I could find each part.
                </p>
            <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects 
            <br>
            <i>How does GDPR impact digital projects?</i></h2>
            <p>All software should be written to comply is local and global laws and guidelines, this often means writing code to defend confidential or sensitive information such as names, addresses, 
                credit card or bank account information. Information should also not be kept longer than it is required, and code should be designed to reflect this requirement. 
                <br>
                <br>
                GDPR meant lots of companies had to go back and ensure their systems were compliant with the news laws and redesign their system if needed. This will have generated a lot of additional 
                work for the systems to be updated to the new requirements and going forward all new system must be designed with these requirements in mind. 	
                <br>
                <br>
                If these guidelines are not followed and there is a data breach, then potentially confidential information could fall into the wrong hands causing issues for customers and the company. 
                Such leaks are often featured in the news, examples include the leak for 150,000 confidential NHS records due to a coding error. These breaches are a problem not only the company/organization 
                the caused the leak but also for the subjects of the data leak. This information can be used to exploit people and can cause harassment and harm. The company/organization also opens itself to 
                negative feedback and potentially the loss of business and could also be subject to large fines.
                <br>
                <br>
                In summary legal guidelines and constraints can cause a large impact on digital projects as they must be considered at all stages of development and future maintenance.
