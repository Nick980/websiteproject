        <h2>About Me</h2>
            I am currently learning to code with CodeNation, learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
            I also have a strong desire to learn Python, C, C# and C++, to expand my knowledge 
            base and to allow me to complete my own projects at home such as Home Secuirty, CCTV, 
            Home Automation and other interests.
            <br>
            <br>
            I did some coding breifly at college before deciding to go into work full time instead of
            further education. IT and computing are hobbies of mine and I regret not taking a career in
            these fields. My hope is to attain a career in the IT industry and to grow my knowledge base,
            with the ultimate goal of one day being freelance and self employed.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been working in retail since the age of 16 and have had a variety of roles from shopfloor,
            to regional and management roles. Unfortuently I had to leave this career due to issues with my 
            mental health and because of this I am now looking for a new career.
