        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change
            approach as needed 
            <br>
            <i>In making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
            E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</i></h2>
            <p>I moved from using codepen.io to using visual studio, whilst both interpret JavaScript each has unique features. Codepen’s ability to update and 
                display the code/webpage is useful for learning and instantly seeing the effects of changing code, however Visual Studio Code’s handles the displaying 
                of code better and it’s ability to help with suggestions and shortcuts for creating code speeds up coding and reduces typing errors.
            <br>    
            <br>
            Trello is a fantastic tool for planning and monitoring a projects progress, especially useful during teamwork but also good to use to plan out individual projects. 
            The ability to add check lists, assign tasks and share with teammates makes the tool very powerful.
            </p>
        <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate 
            <br>
            <i>E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</i></h2>
            <p>To create my website, I used Trello to help plan the site and then used visual studio code to create the code for the site. Trello was an excellent tool for creating the site and allowed me to plan out and complete the pages correctly. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Visual Studio Code was also an excellent tool to complete the code and its ability to auto complete suggestions for code was a great help. The way Studio Code presents the pages and parts of the project greatly helped speed up writing the code and seeing where issues were.  In the future I would however probably switch to the full version of Visual Studio as it has significantly more features.
            <br>   
            <br>
                I also used Photoshop Elements to edit and fix images used for the site, however in the future I would like to use the full version of 
                Photoshop and Premiere for photo and video creation as these provide more features and options for editing. Alternatively, Shotcut and Final Cut Pro X would be excellent replacements for Premiere
            </p>
        <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project 
            <br> 
            <i>Are you happy with your website?
            Why? Why not? You should review it on the
            website itself in the interests of openness. What
            would you change?</i></h2>
            <p>Whilst I am overall happy with my final site I would in future better plan for device cross compatibility and use flex and grid to better align the contents of my website one different display aspect ratio’s and mobile devices.
            <br>
            <br>
            I believe the design language is well connected and the website is easy to read and use, however in future I would also like to look at better accessibility for people with disabilities. I would also like to add some animation to the site to allow for a more interactive experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            Initially my site looked quite different but early on I decided I was not satisfied with the design and changed it to the current design. Given more time I would imagine that there would be at least one more minor revision to complete the changes mentioned previously. 
            </p>
        <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make
            to your project</h2>
            <p>Improvements I would make to the site include adding accessibility features for those with disabilities, such as reviewing screen reader functionality and potentially alternative colour schemes for those with colour blindness.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would like to improve the device compatibility of the site as it currently does not display well on small screens and has no mobile compatibility. This could be done using Flex and Grid to align the components of the website in a better fashion than I currently have.  
            <br>
            <br>
            I would also like to add animations to create a more interactive and engaging experience, such as having each questions opacity change as you scroll through the website or having the question pop in as you navigate down the site
            </p>
        <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
            <p>I made my pages as error free as possible by repeatedly testing each page to ensure all the links worked and correctly navigated around the site. I also tested the page on different browsers and at different screen resolutions to check that the page remained readable and flowed correctly. I also adjusted several of the background images to correctly match the overall theme of the website and to ensure they fitted the screen correctly and that they did not interfere with the text readability.        The content for each page was carefully considered and laid out for best readability and presentation. Several reviews of how each page flowed were performed and acted upon until I was happy with the overall design and content.
