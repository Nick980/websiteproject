            3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools
            and systems used in terms of productivity and
            efficiency 
            <br>
            <i>Could you have been more efficient
            when making your websOneite? How? Could you have
            done it in teams?</i>
            </h2>
            <p>IT tools can have many benefits in terms of productivity and efficiency, tools like Trello can help reduce time working 
                out what bits of a project have been completed and which still need to be done. Tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams can 
                reduce the number of meetings and conference calls needed on a project and allow team to focus on the creation of content.
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of my own project I could have done a better job of planning out the initial layout of my site before starting to 
                put it together, this may have reduced time spent trying out different layouts and struggling with how elements should be positioned. 
            </p>
            <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
            <p>The best way to improve productivity and efficiency is to reduce the amount of time teams spend away from core tasks. 
                Reducing time spent at and traveling to meetings using Trello, Slack and Microsoft Teams allows teams to still get the key information 
                and focus on the tasks at hand. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Using sites like GitHub to ensure everyone is working on the same codebase also reduces time spent working on conflicting 
                codes due to poor version control. This also allows quick sharing of new ideas and revisions between team members without having to bring the team
                together for unnecessary meetings and catch ups
                <br>
                <br>
                Ensuring the scope and plan for the project is correct at the start of a new project will also improve efficiency as the project can be correctly 
                broken down into tasks with out the concern of new tasks having to be added or old tasks being revisited due to a change in requirements.
                </p>
            <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity
            using IT in digital projects 
            <br>
            <i>What would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</i></h2>
            <p>In the future to improve my productivity I would look to use Slack and fellow team mates to help troubleshoot issues and get suggestions 
                on how to solve problems as they arise. I would have also spent more time planning the layout of my site instead of jumping in and trying
                out different ideas with no initial plan of how the end product would look.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Using Slack and Trello Boards to share the workload with fellow teammates would also free up time for me to focus on other aspects of a 
                specific project and allow me to draw on other team members experience and ideas to improve the site presentation, code and content. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Working with other team members may have also lead to a better design theme and navigation style, whilst also allowing me to add the accessability 
                features I have mentioned previously, such as colourblind modes and audio description tags. 
            </p>
            <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing
            digital solutions</h2>
            <p>When testing digital solutions, it is best to adopt a testing methodology such as Agile or DevOps. This provides a framework for the 
                testers to follow. Testers should embrace the unpredictability that comes with testing within Agile and DevOps teams. Using AI tools, 
                testers can increase test effectiveness, as the tool can identify the areas of code where tests are likely to fail and focus testing 
                on those areas.

                Getting other team members to test the final product and also testing iterations of parts of the project may  also been beneficial to see how
                they go about interacting with the site and looking for any potential issues end users might encounter. Testing with external users may also be 
                beneficial as they may interact with the project in a different way to technical members of the team. This kind of alpha and beta testing 
                allows you to have many eyes on the project and to comprehensivley test a project. We see this happening in the gaming industry where members of
                the player base are given access to new features to comprehensivley test them and provide feedback. The more eye on a project the less likely errors
                or poor design will slip through to the final product
