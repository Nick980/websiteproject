        <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>
        <p>The website I have created contains the following pages:
            <br>
            <br>
            Home/Welcome Screen – Clean page showing links on to the other pages of the site
            <br>
            Unit One Outcome 1 – contains the questions and answers relevant to this part of the course
            <br>
            Unit One Outcome 2 – contains the questions and answers relevant to this part of the course
            <br>
            Unit One Outcome 3 – contains the questions and answers relevant to this part of the course
            <br>
            Unit Two Outcome 1 – contains the questions and answers relevant to this part of the course
            <br>
            About me – a page containing details about myself, such as my interest in coding, hobbies and previous employment.Also includes links to my Twitter and LinkedIn accounts
            <br>
            <br>
            Each page contains a pop-out side menu linking to the other parts of the website, a title found in the top right of each page letting the user know where they currently are on the site. Each page has a unique background but share a common theme and colour scheme to help tie them together. 
            </p>
        <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
        <p>Each website should be aware of the source of all its materials and contents and should have the 
            appropriate permissions or licence to use this content. Failure to ensure you have the permission 
            or ownership of the content can lead to potentially costly legal issues, costs associated with 
            redesigning the website or ultimately the website being taken down.
            <br>
            <br>
            Good examples of these problems can be seen with Youtube and its copyright takedown, copyright strike or 
            content ID claim systems which aim to protect the rights or content creators but also cause issues with false 
            positives and malicious use of these systems
            <br>
            <br>
            Other issues facing websites is ensuring any content is accurate and fact checked as misleading or false 
            information can lead to reputational damage and legal issues should anyone find issue with the content. 
            </p>
        <h2>1.6  Describing access issues that need taking into account
            <br>
            <br>
        <i>Describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and 
            how we can overcome them</i>
        </h2>
        <p>Disabled people face many issues when accessing websites dependant on their particular disability, 
            it is our job as website creators to anticipate these issues and design our site accordingly.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, people with visual impairment may need to use a screen reader to access a sites content, 
            in this case we should ensure all images have descriptor tags and videos have subtitles and or audio 
            description functions. People with colour blindness may benefit from alternative colour schemes to allow 
            them to better navigate a website and consume its content. Users with hearing impairment may benefit from 
            subtitles for audio and visual content.
        </p>
        <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
        <p>Files come in many types and the appropriate type will depend on the website. Common file types to expect are;
            <br>
            <br>
            Audio – .wav .mp3 .aac .mid .midi
            <br>
            <br>
            Video – .webm .flv .mov .qt . avi .rm .wmv .mpg .mpeg .mp4
            <br>
            <br>
            Images – .jpg .jpeg .tif .tiff .gif .png .svg
            <br>
            <br>
            Each file type has its advantages and disadvantages and it is dependant on the website creator to select the format 
            which is best for the task. For example, sites with large detailed images may be slow to load on mobile devices and a 
            smaller file size may be desirable at the cost of some quality.
            <br>
            <br>
            The same applies to video sites like YouTube, storing videos in their raw format can require significant disk space. 
            YouTube compresses the videos uploaded to the site to take up less disk space whilst sacrificing quality. In my personal
             experience uploading content to YouTube a recording may start life as a multi gigabyte file and after editing and 
             uploading to YouTube the final file may be less than a gigabyte depending on the compression methods used.
